# YieldWise Project
This project was designed to provide hardworking farmers with valuable insight into their farm produce and sales.
It combines the joint effort of data analysts, product designers, and web developers.
A two-week final project was assigned as the final project for the Genesy Tech Hub Upskill program 2024.
My major contribution was providing valuable insights from the data exploration on the given dataset.
